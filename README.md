ECG Signal Preprocessing Pipeline

This repository provides a complete ECG signal preprocessing pipeline implemented in Python. It includes the following standard preprocessing steps:

1. **Removal of large amplitude spikes (artifacts)**
2. **Low-pass filtering**
3. **Powerline interference removal (notch filter)**
4. **Baseline wander and offset removal**
5. **Detection of disconnected ECG channels**

The implementation is modular, allowing individual functions to be reused or modified independently.
